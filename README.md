### WebServer
It is a simple web server implemented by C, homework(maybe?) of Linux Network Programming

It turns out the teacher changes his opinion, web server is not in our final project list, I am so sad about it.

But I think the it helps me get familiar with epoll, and then I write a Chatroom using epoll running on Ubuntu as my final project.

And I think the web server runs successfully, although the Makefile is like a shit.

You can just `make` and then `./myhttpd`
